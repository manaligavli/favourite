A drink (or beverage) is a liquid intended for human consumption. 
In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. 
Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and soft drinks. 
In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years.
Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as beer and wine, but are made with less than .5 percent alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.
